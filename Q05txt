A favicon (short for favorites icon) is a small, iconic image associated with a website. It appears next to the page title in the browser tab, in the browser’s bookmark list, and in other places like the address bar or mobile home screen. Favicons help improve brand recognition and enhance the user experience by making the website easily identifiable.

Favicon Example:

Create a Favicon:

The favicon is usually a 16x16 or 32x32 pixel square image (often in .ico, .png, or .jpg format).
For example, you could use a logo or a simplified version of your website’s brand.
Link the Favicon in HTML:

To include a favicon in your HTML document, you’ll use a <link> tag in the <head> section of your HTML.

CODE :-


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Website</title>

    <!-- Favicon for the website -->
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">

    <!-- Optional: Favicon for different platforms -->
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.png" type="image/png">
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="apple-touch-icon.png">
    <meta name="theme-color" content="#ffffff">

</head>

<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
